# README.md for Headers in C - Introduction

## Overview
This module introduces the concept of header files in C programming. Header files are a crucial component of C programs, especially when dealing with large projects. They provide a way to separate the definition of a function from its implementation, allowing for better organization and code management.

## Description
In C, header files typically have a `.h` extension and contain function prototypes, macro definitions, and structures. They act as an interface to the corresponding source files, which contain the actual code definitions.

## Importance of Header Files
- **Modularity**: Header files enable a modular programming approach, allowing for separate compilation of source files.
- **Reusability**: Functions defined in one file can be easily used in other files through the inclusion of header files.
- **Maintainability**: Separating declarations from implementations makes the code easier to navigate and maintain.
- **Scalability**: For large projects, headers provide a way to scale the codebase in an organized manner.

## Basic Usage
To use a header file, you must include it in your C source file using the `#include` preprocessor directive. There are two types of includes:
- `#include <filename>`: Used for standard library header files.
- `#include "filename"`: Used for user-defined header files.

## Header Guards
Header files should have header guards to prevent double inclusion, which can cause errors. Header guards are typically implemented using preprocessor directives:

```c
#ifndef HEADER_FILE_NAME_H
#define HEADER_FILE_NAME_H

// Declarations

#endif // HEADER_FILE_NAME_H
```

## Example Header File
Here is a simple example of what a header file might look like:

```c
// math_functions.h

#ifndef MATH_FUNCTIONS_H
#define MATH_FUNCTIONS_H

int add(int a, int b);
int subtract(int a, int b);

#endif // MATH_FUNCTIONS_H
```

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful names for header files.
- Include header guards to prevent double inclusion issues.
- Group related declarations together in the same header file.
- Include comments to explain the purpose and usage of the functions.

### Task 1: Single Header Inclusion
**Objective**: Create a header file and include it in your main program file.
- Create a header file `greetings.h` that declares a function `void say_hello(void);`.
- Implement the `say_hello` function in a separate `greetings.c` file that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- In your `main.c`, include the `greetings.h` header and call the `say_hello` function.
- The executable should be named `hello`.

**Files**:
- `greetings.h`
- `greetings.c`
- `main.c`

### Task 2: Multiple Header Inclusions
**Objective**: Create multiple header files and include them in a single main program file.
- Create two header files, `math_operations.h` and `print_operations.h`.
- `math_operations.h` declares functions - 
add, substract, devide, multyply. `print_operations.h` declares a function `void print_result(int result);`.
- Implement these functions in `math_operations.c` and `print_operations.c` respectively.
- The `main.c` file should include both headers and use the declared functions to add, substract, devide, multyply two numbers and print the result.
- The executable should be named `math_printer`.

**Files**:
- `math_operations.h`
- `math_operations.c`
- `print_operations.h`
- `print_operations.c`
- `main.c`

### Task 3: Nested Header Inclusions
**Objective**: Create a nested header inclusion scenario where one header file includes another.
- Create a header file `array_utils.h` that declares a function `void fill_array(int* array, int size, int value);`.
- Create another header file `utils.h` that includes `array_utils.h` and declares another function `void print_array(int* array, int size);`.
- Implement these functions in `array_utils.c` and `utils.c`.
- In `main.c`, include `utils.h` and

## Conclusion
Mastering the use of header files is essential for developing complex C programs. They provide the means to create a clear and efficient codebase that is easy to manage and expand.
